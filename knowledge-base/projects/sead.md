Smart Energy Analytic Disaggregation Systems (SEADS) was a PhD research project focused on energy consumption analysis. As a frontend developer, I collaborated with postdoc researchers to build a web application for monitoring and analyzing household energy usage.

### Key Contributions

- Developed an interactive dashboard using JavaScript and modern web frameworks to visualize real-time energy consumption data
- Built features to disaggregate and analyze energy usage patterns by individual appliances
- Integrated frontend with SEADS hardware devices and backend database systems
- Implemented RESTful APIs to enable seamless communication between web interface and monitoring devices
- Created responsive data visualizations and charts to display energy analytics
- Designed an intuitive user interface for monitoring and tracking energy consumption patterns

### Technologies Used
- Frontend: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- Data Visualization: D3.js, Chart.js
- API Integration: REST, WebSocket
- Version Control: Git
