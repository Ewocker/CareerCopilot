# Yu-An Lin - Professional Profile

## Summary

Full-Stack Engineer | AI Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner

Yu-An Lin is a skilled full-stack engineer with extensive experience in cloud infrastructure, distributed systems, and web development. Currently working as a Computer Scientist at Adobe's GenStudio team, Yu-An specializes in building robust, scalable software solutions and has a growing focus on AI engineering.

With a background spanning enterprise systems at Adobe and cloud infrastructure management at Proofpoint, Yu-An brings strong technical expertise across the full software development lifecycle. He has particular strengths in Kubernetes administration, CI/CD pipeline development, and frontend/backend development using modern frameworks and technologies.

Yu-An is currently expanding his expertise in machine learning and AI through Georgia Tech's OMSCS program, with a focus on applying AI technologies to solve complex engineering problems and build next-generation intelligent systems.

Yu-An is a hands-on learner who adapts quickly to new environments and challenges. Rephrasing a quote from his managers at Adobe: "I like to move Yu-An to different projects every once in a while because he can immediately contribute to any team and make an impact from day two if not the first day." This adaptability was demonstrated when Yu-An joined the GenStudio team and made significant contributions to the Adobe Summit demo features within his first two weeks, while also fixing bugs in the extensibility framework on just his second day. Similarly, he has been on many different team while working with AEM Assets teams and always getting positve feedbacks from peers.
